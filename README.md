# Helloworld

A BranchKit plugin

A [BranchKit](https://github.com/branchkit) plugin in TypeScript, scaffolded by
`branchkit-cli dev init`. It ships one action, two voice commands and one key
binding: a skeleton to replace with your own.

## What it does

| Trigger | Result |
|---|---|
| Say "hello branchkit" | Types "Hello, BranchKit!" at the cursor |
| Say "hello" and the name of an installed app | Types a greeting naming that app |
| Press `alt+shift+h` | Same as "hello branchkit" |

It also adds a Getting Started tab to its card in BranchKit's settings. The
app names come from the `apps` collection, which the bundled system plugin
provides.

## Build

```bash
branchkit-cli dev build
```

A TypeScript plugin runs as one compiled binary, `helloworld-plugin`, in this
directory. Rebuild after every change (`branchkit-cli dev watch` does it on
save). The build uses BranchKit's own pinned Bun, so nothing needs installing
first, and people who install your plugin need no JavaScript runtime at all.

If `plugin.json` declares `sockets.listen`, the same command builds on Node
instead. You do not choose, and your code does not change.

## Test

```bash
branchkit-cli dev test .     # manifest and source checks, then conformance
bun test                     # this plugin's own tests (src/index.test.ts)
```

`bun test` needs Bun on your `PATH`. The conformance run and the tests start
the plugin under `branchkit-test-harness`, which runs a real matcher and event
bus without the app. The harness ships inside the BranchKit app. Without it,
`dev test` skips conformance, and `bun test` fails with a message saying where
the harness is looked for. Set `BRANCHKIT_TEST_HARNESS` to use a copy
elsewhere.

## Install

```bash
branchkit-cli plugin install . --build
```

This builds, copies the plugin into BranchKit's plugins folder, and asks a
running app to load it.

## Change it

- **Actions** are declared in `action_types` in `plugin.json`.
  `src/actions_gen.ts` is generated from them; after editing, regenerate it
  with [branchkit-gen](https://github.com/branchkit/branchkit-gen):
  `branchkit-gen --plugin .`
- **Voice commands** are in `commands.json`.
- **The key binding** is under `collection_data` → `_platform.bindings` in
  `plugin.json`.
- **Permissions** are `requires` in `plugin.json`. The plugin runs sandboxed
  and gets only what it declares; this one asks for the `input` privilege so it
  can type.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `plugin.json` | Manifest: identity, permissions, actions, key binding, settings tab |
| `commands.json` | Voice command patterns and the actions they trigger |
| `src/index.ts` | Handler logic: your plugin's behavior |
| `src/actions_gen.ts` | Typed action params, generated from `plugin.json` |
| `src/index.test.ts` | Tests against the test harness |
| `.github/workflows/conformance.yml` | On a `v*` tag: the static checks |
| `helloworld-plugin` | The compiled plugin: build output, not checked in |

## Continuous checks

`.github/workflows/conformance.yml` runs `branchkit-cli dev test . --static-only`
on every `v*` tag. It downloads a released `branchkit-cli` binary, and none is
published yet, so it cannot complete until one is.

## Platform documentation

The full platform docs ship with the app as markdown. Grep them rather than
guessing. They are the reference for the manifest, the RPC surface, matching,
collections, and the event bus.

```bash
branchkit-cli docs sync          # once, after installing or updating BranchKit
grep -rl "requires_tags" "$(branchkit-cli docs path)"
```

Start with `guide/getting-started/quickstart.md` in that directory.

## When it does not work

The running app answers questions no document can, because the answer depends
on what else is installed and what state the machine is in. Turn on Developer
Access on this plugin's card in BranchKit's settings first; these commands use
that grant and see only this plugin.

```bash
branchkit-cli dev plog helloworld --since 60s          # what this plugin logged
branchkit-cli dev say "hello branchkit" --simulate  # what would run, without running it
branchkit-cli dev chain                                   # recent records, then: dev chain <tr_id>
branchkit-cli dev events --plugin helloworld --source audit --types 'consent.**'   # attempted and refused
```
